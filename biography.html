      ... and i'm a student learning like 3 coding languages at once because apparently they all go together. I currently take SDD as a class at PLC and this biography is a project that we have been working on during class. Here are some facts about
      me. (i guess?)

        Typing speed: 125 wpm on a good day. (I've been trying to improve my
        productivity by improving my typing speed. It's not working. Instead of
        doing work, I just waste time taking typing tests and justifying that
        this is a long term investment that will be worth it when i can type
        fast. Currently, my goal is to reach a consistent average of 148wpm by
        the end of this year.)

        Number of unread emails in my inbox right now: 38173 (3 years ago, I was
        sitting next to my friend and they had 200 unread emails and for some
        reason, I decided that I would collect more emails than them, subscribed
        to a bunch of random websites that give me spam and 3 years later, I
        have a nunch of spam that I can't be bothered to get rid of.)
